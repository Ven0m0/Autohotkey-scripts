# Robocopy-generator
An AHK Script I am working on, It's supposed to be a learning trip as well as something useful.

At this point it can only create a useless batch file.
Any help and/or suggestions are much welcome!


Simple roadmap
1. Keep it simple, get all the existing GUI features to work.
2. Fix most of the possible bugs
3. Continue with more advanced features
4. Fix bugs again.
